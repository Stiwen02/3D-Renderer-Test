# 3D-Renderer-Test
 An attempt at making a 3D renderer, mostly made for the ESP32.
# Issues
 - Wireframes behind the camera sometimes glitching out.
 - Lines sometimes disappearing even if its still supposed to be on the screen. 
 - Lagging when rendering more than 80 cubes.
# Todo
 - Make engine.sort_draw work in both False and True.
 - Disable custom outline sizes when engine.esp32 is True.
