# 3D-Renderer-Test
 An attempt at making a 3D renderer, mostly made for the ESP32.
# Issues
 - Cubes not rotating correctly when more than a single axis is changed in its rotation.
 - Some wireframes disappearing when not required.
 - Lagging when rendering more than 80 cubes.
# Todo
 - Add Z axis to rotation
 - Add colors to wireframes
